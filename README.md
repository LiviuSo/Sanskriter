# Sanskriter

An app based on the book "Complete Sanskrit" by Michael Coulson.

It contains:
  - the book itself with easy navigation and easy to find grammatical concepts.

  - a dictionary holding all the vocabulary in the book. The dictionary will offer the capability to recognise grammatical forms 
  (eg, nouns/adjectives at a declensions or conjugated verbs). This dictionary is meant as a helper in solving the exercises in the book. 
  The dictionary is Sanskrit-English and sanskrit-romanian for now, but more languages may be added.
  
  - a grammar utility to detect sandhi
  
  - a simple sanskrit keyboard that, in the context of the application, will switch automatically between IAST and Devanagari scripts 
  as the user types on edits. The keyboard is functional, but it needs rework - mainly merging QWERTY and IAST layouts.
  
Ultimately, to put all the pieces together, we intend to create a kind of automated translator. This will not necessarily translate a sanskrit sentence,
but will give hints on the connections between the sentence words, thus helping the reader to find a possible translation.


Any comment or suggestion is greatly appreciated. Thank you!
